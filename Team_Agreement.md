**Conflict Plan**

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises?: 

```
Group meeting to discuss problem and come up with solution. Safe environment, not attacking each other. Should address conflict without attacking or being attacked.
```

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?:

```
Communicate early. Bring stuff up before it becomes an internal crisis. Be mindful about how you feel.
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?: Our goal is to resolve it ourselves or we bring someone in before the problem gets too big. However, if any conflicts that have been attempted to be resolved linger into mid week, etc we will escalate the conflict resolvement. We see resolution as being an agreement that follows group voting protocol.
```

**Communication Plan**

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?: 

```
Slack
```

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?:

```
 Ask everyone’s opinion on topics. Informal stand up to check in with each other. Have conversations about how the day went.
 ```

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?: 

```
Be nice to each other. If you feel like you’re not being heard, speak up. We will be open to each others’ opinions. Encourage being wrong about things, you need to be wrong to find the right ideas. It’s okay to try things even if they don’t work. Limit passive aggressive behavior, use clear communication.
```

**Work Plan**

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?: 

```
We will have a meeting format. Address it in our informal tasks and have circle backs. Identify tasks on Monday.
```

- What project management tool will be used?: 

```
Trello
```

- What are your working hours?:

```
9am - 6pm is "on hours" working time. Anything after that falls into the after hours work policy.
```

- Can people work on the project after hours? What is the policy:

```
There will be a set plan at the end of the day, if anyone is to do after hours work. 
```


**Git Process**

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?: 

```
back end repo and front end repo
```

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?: 

```
Organization and add everyone as contributors
```

- What is your Git flow?: 

```
See below
```

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

```
See below
```

- How many people must review a PR?: 

```
We will have a DEV branch underneath main, and each of us will work on branches off this dev branch. For PRs to DEV, 2 people need to review and merge the PR, but we want to have everyone reviewing/reading the code to understand what’s going on and what changes are being made. Don’t rush to review PRs. For PR's to main, we use a Team Review with shared screen.
```

- Who merges PRs?: 

```
Anyone except the person who made the PR 
```

- How often will you merge?: 

```
When needed and when we decide that it needs to be merged aka when we want to.
How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?: Post to slack any time we want to do a merge.
